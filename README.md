# Planet-Labels

We are using machine learning and computer vision techniques to classify land cover from satellite images we gathered from the San Francisco start-up Planet Labs. With this project, we can differentiate between a large number of land cover classes, such as forest, crops, barren land, water, wetlands etc., and will be using this to look into temporal changes to out planet. 
This could be helpful to environmentalists, who'd want to know of illegal deforestation and the shrinking rate of certain water bodies, and also to urban planners to track the growth of cities.
